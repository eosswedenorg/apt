  interactive ncurses client for haproxy
  HATop is an interactive ncurses client and real-time monitoring, statistics
  displaying tool for the HAProxy TCP/HTTP load balancer.

  HATop's appearance is similar to top(1). It supports various modes for
  detailed statistics of all configured proxies and services in near realtime.
  In addition, it features an interactive CLI for the haproxy unix socket.
  This allows administrators to control the given haproxy instance (change
  server weight, put servers into maintenance mode, ...) directly out of hatop
  (using keybinds or the CLI) and monitor the results immediately.
